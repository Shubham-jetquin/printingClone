                                        the Site. All online payments will be conducted in accordance
                                        with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards (which
                                        are high!) and your billing information (which is only used by

                                        protection) is encrypted before being communicated to them.
                                        Subject to the below exceptions, your card details are
                                        communicated directly from your browser to these payment
                                        processors - MOO never (ever!) sees your full Permanent Account
                                        Number (PAN). This means that the payment form is either
                                        off-site or displayed in a frame on the payment page.
                                    </p>

                                        For Worldpay and Stripe, if on the payment page you have
                                        requested that your card details be remembered (it’s such a
                                        timesaver!) and the payment was successful, MOO stores the card
                                        type, a Masked PAN (only the first 6 and last 4 digits) and the
                                        card’s expiry date as well as an associated token. We store this
                                        information so that you and we can identify your stored card and
                                        use it for further payments at MOO. We also store separately the
                                        last 4 digits and card type so that we can identify transactions
                                        made by a particular card.

                        and Marketing and Communications Data to form a picture of you and what
                        we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This
                        is how we decide which Products &amp; Services and offers may be
                        relevant for you and tell you about them. This is what we call direct
                        marketing.

                    <p>
                        We may carry out direct marketing by email, phone, text or post. For
                        example, you might have the MOOsletter hit your inbox, a discount code
                        texted to you, a cool promotion land on your door mat or a phone call to
                        tell you something that might be relevant to you or your business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may send you marketing communications if you have previously
                        requested information from us or purchased our Products &amp; Services
                        from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. On our
                        website, we always try hard to make it really clear what we are doing
                        and what communications you will be sent, whether it’s you deciding to
                        sign up to the MOOsletter and other marketing, or as part of creating an
                        account or the purchase journey. You have a right at any time to change
                        your mind and say no thank you and opt out (but we’d be really sorry to
                        see you go, so please give us a chance by fine tuning your preferences
                        before really leaving us!).

                        Of course, there are lots of different ways you’ll see adverts for MOO
                        out and about, and not all of these are based on using personal data –
                        sometimes we just buy good old-fashioned advertising space in the real
                        world and websites and social media. If you see MOO’s adverts on
                        websites and in social media, these may not be directed specifically at
                        you, we might just have bid for the space. In social media you can often
                        find out why you have seen a particular advert which will tell you if it
                        has only been directed at an audience rather than at you personally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our adverts
                        and use analytics and retargeting for this reason. We use
                        Device/Technical Data or Usage Data from cookies and similar
                        technologies to help us to deliver website and social advertising that
                        we believe is most relevant to you and to potential new customers of
                        MOO. The cookies used for this purpose are often placed on our Site by
                        specialist organisations – and this is also why when you’ve been on our

                        For example, they make it easy to log in and move from page to page, and

                        Our emails often contain a ‘web beacon pixel’ to tell us whether, and
                        how many times, our emails are opened and if you click through to links
                        or adverts in the email. This is so that we can determine which of our
                        emails and adverts are engaging users/customers. When you delete the
                        email, the pixel will be deleted. If you do not wish the pixel to be
                        downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us
                        in plain text instead of HTML (you can do this via your email provider
                        settings). Alternatively, you can choose not to display images on your
                        emails from us, which also prevents the open pixel from tracking.
