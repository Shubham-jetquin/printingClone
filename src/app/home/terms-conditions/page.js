                                        MOO uses its reasonable efforts to ensure that the Standard
                                        Prices are correct at the time when the relevant information was
                                        entered onto the system. However, MOO sells a large number of
                                        products through the Site. Despite MOO’s efforts, some of the
                                        MOO Products on the Site may be incorrectly priced. If MOO
                                        discovers an error in the price of the MOO Products in an Order,
                                        MOO will contact you to inform you of this error and give you
                                        the option of continuing to purchase the MOO Products at the
                                        correct price or canceling the Order. MOO will not process the
                                        Order until it has your instructions. If MOO is unable to
                                        contact you using the contact details provided by you during the
                                        order process, MOO will treat the Order as canceled, notify you
                                        in writing and refund any sums already paid by you for the MOO
                                        Products.

                                        Customer Assets or following your instructions, or because of a
                                        mistake you made in the Design; (d) you alter or repair the MOO
